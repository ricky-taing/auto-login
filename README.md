## CITATIONS:
I watched INDENTLY's tutorial on Youtube and added functionality to login to LeetCode.

## TO-DO LIST:
1. Open and navigate to other tabs
2. Add to fav group button
3. Decouple the login function by adding website as an argument rather than hard coding. Use if statements, HashMap?
4. Add functionality for any browser, starting with Chrome and Firefox.
